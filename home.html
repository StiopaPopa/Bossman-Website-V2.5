          Edgyliveleak was created back in June 2017 by Edgy, the page was
          originally liveleak graphic videos and memes all created by Edgy
          himself. After the first page got banned after having gained over 200k
          followers in a few months, he consequently quickly opened the 2nd and
          3rd pages gaining in both instances hundreds of thousands of
          followers. His latest page @edgyliveleak4 goes back to the roots of
          his first page leaking bloody news over Instagram while keeping his
          retarded meme mindset.

          Created in late 2017 originally with the intention of being a fan
          page, then subsequently transitioned into a meme page, and now is the
          home of the bossman army: a cult-like following. Negus is also known
          to be the bossman commander and with edgyliveleak are both regarded as
          the creators of Bossman who have managed to orchestrate countless
          monumental raids, and many more to come in the future.

          Bossman raids' official page initially named bossmanraids was created
          in 2018 by @negusflex and @edgyliveleak4 and managed to reach all of
          our fellow bossmen troops for all our successful raids accumulating
          over 95.000 bossmen. After a few months the page got taken down. The
          newer page @bossmanbase maintains the same mindset and dedication as
          the first page. The official meeting place before and during a raid
          for all our fellow bossmen!

      <h1>Origin and Brief History</h1>
      <p>
        Bossman is not just a community it’s a way of life. Founded in 2018 by
        Instagram users Negusflex and Edgyliveleak, the Bossman Army managed to
        successfully raid celebrities and even random small accounts achieving
        thousands of comments from our fellow commanders and recluteès of the
        Bossman Army itself! By joining our army you are granted a personal
        platform to fulfill your edgiest thought while being part of what will
        be and already is the strongest raid army on many different platforms.
      </p>
      <h1>What We Do</h1>
      <p>
        The purpose of this website is to provide a platform for us to share
        content such as memes and gore within an unrestricted environment for
        you, the followers. In addition, this website serves as a
        constantly-updated site to provide updates regarding future raids and
        our strategic approaches, as well as to utilise our brand new feature
        known as the "Raid Countdown": as the clock will tick closer and closer
        towards the time of the raid, members of the Bossman Army will gather on
        the website and prepare themseleves to march into the battlefield once
        the timer hits 0. We're looking forward to your contribution, Bossman,
        everyone's active aid will be needed and greatly appreciated!
